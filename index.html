        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>
          I'm Joshua Hindley. I'm an aspiring software engineer based in Wellington, currently working as a Software
          Engineer L2 with OpenBet.
          <br /><br />
          I have a passion for developing functional and high-quality software. I am interested in further developing my
          skills full-stack development, especially React and Java. I especially enjoy the problem solving and creative
          aspects of programming and I love getting stuck into a problem and finding and implementing a logical and
          practical solution.
          <br /><br />
          I am diligent, self-motivated, and have strong technical skills, especially in Java and React. These
          attributes are reflected in my academic record as they allowed me to achieve A-level grades in all of my
          courses, earning me a spot on the Dean's List for all three years of my study (2018-2020).
