				<h2>Hi there!</h2>
				<br>
				<h3>I'm Joshua Hindley. I'm an aspiring software engineer based in Wellington	and
					Tauranga, currently looking for a full-time junior role in software development in
					either city.
					<br><br>
					I have a passion for developing functional and high-quality software. I am interested
					in further developing my skills front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, as
					well as	mobile development. I especially enjoy the problem solving and creative
					aspects of programming and I love getting stuck into a problem and finding and
					implementing a logical and practical solution.
					<br><br>
					I am diligent, self-motivated, and have strong technical skills, especially in Java
					development. These attributes are reflected in my academic record as they allowed
					me to achieve A-level grades in all of my courses, earning me a spot on the Dean's
					List for all three years of my study so far (2018-2020).
